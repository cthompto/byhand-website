      <h3>Ethics</h3>
      <p>
        At the time of writing this it is early 2023, a time of ongoing climate
        crisis, widely available machine learning platforms, floundering social
        media monoliths, and general political turmoil. Given this context, I
        think we must be intentional about how and why we use the internet. For
        me, hand coding offers me the chance to slow down and consider how my
        work can be responsive to the context in which we live. Below, I will
        cover a few areas of consideration creating websites now.
      </p>
      <h4>Sustainability</h4>
      <p>
        Terms like ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù encourage us to forget about the material reality
        and environmental impact of digital media. From the rare earth metals
        found in almost all consumer electronics to the fossil fuels powering
        much of our electric grid, our digital activities have an ecological
        cost. I think hand coding offers one way for us to consider the content
        we create and publish more carefully. I wrote a blog that covers this
        subject more in depth here:

          >https://chelsea.technology/writing/blog/posts/8_26_22.html</a
        >
      </p>
      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <p>
        The artworld often falls short in making spaces and experiences
        accessible. I am not an expert in these matters but the artist Jaklin
        Romine has an ongoing project that highlights these issues which can be
        viewed here:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.jaklinromine.com/work/access-denied"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.jaklinromine.com/work/access-denied</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        These failures, which are often exacerbated by other ableist systems and
        assumptions, are not erased by shift online but moving online can
        provide an opportunity for work to be more accessible especially if the
        idea of accessibility is baked into a project from the beginning. I
        believe that coding sites by hand offers us greater understanding of the
        underlying structure of a website which can be leveraged to think
        critically about how to publish the content in an accessible way. One
        simple way to start thinking about this issue is to understand how to
        write effective alt text. The project
        <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/" target="_blank"
          >Alt Text as Poetry</a
        >
        and more accessibility tools can be found on the Resources page.
      </p>
      <h4>Privacy</h4>
      <p>
        Data privacy is a complex issue to unpack and at least in the United
        States, most folks don't understand it as outlined in a new (Feb 2023)
        study:

      </p>
      <p>
        I am no data expert but I do know that I don't want to be contributing
        unknowingly to this problem. Sites like Wix and Squarespace often
        include tracking and analytics in the web templates and that data might
        be going places you don't understand. Building sites by hand allows you
        to cut out these practices, creating faster loading and more private
        experiences for visitors to your site.
      </p>
      <h3>Additions and Collaborations</h3>
      <p>
        If you have suggestions for things I should add or would like to
        contribute something of your own, please drop me a line at
        chelseathomptoart(at)gmail(dot)com. I would love to expand this and have
        others join in, my main focus is to provide information that is up to
        date and approachable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan on adding to the site as time and energy allows, especially when
        I generate new guides and resources for my classes. I also aim to add
        the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Better mobile layout</li>
        <li>Light and dark mode toggling</li>
        <li>Standard and high contrast color mode toggling</li>
        <li>Background graphic toggling</li>
      </ul>
