            <h1>Guides</h1>
            <p>This page contains guides and code examples I have created over the past few years of teaching. It is not meant to be a linear or step-by-step system but rather it is organized into sections that correspond to the questions I receive most frequently. That being said, if you are completely new to coding, going down the guides in order would be a good way to start. The code examples are hosted on their own pages via GitHub and links to both the repository (where you can view and download the raw code) and the live site are provided for each. Scroll or click on the links below to go to jump to a given section:</p>
            <p><a href="./#looking">Looking</a></p>
            <p><a href="./#planning">Planning</a></p>
            <p><a href="./#coding">Coding</a></p>
            <p>Additionally, every heading and subheading (the ones in light and dark blue) are also links to themselves so you can easily bookmark a given section to refer to later or share with a friend.</p>

            <h2><a class="header-link" href="https://byhand.website/guides/#looking">Looking</a></h2>
            <p>This section covers how to look at code examples and sites you like in order to learn how they work (including this one!).</p>
            <h3>Using Your Browser's Inspection Tools</h3>
            <p>Most contemporary web browsers have a built-in inspector tool that allows you to look at the source code of a given page and hover over elements on the page itself to see the associated code. These tools are extremely useful both in exploring other peopleâ€™s sites and analyzing your own. It should be noted however that using the inspector on websites like Facebook, Twitter, CNN, or other large corporate sites will be much harder to read as much of their HTML and CSS is generated by other scripts in order to deliver dynamic content, ads, tracking, etc. This article from Hubspot does a good job of explaining how to use the inspector tools on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari:</p> 
            <p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect" target="_blank">https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect</a></p>
            <p>
            Getting in the habit of using the inspector when you find something new or interesting on a site (or when you encounter a bug/glitch) can really help you see how code functions in a practical scenario.
            </p>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>One thing to look out for as you are looking at other people's code is the use of comments. Comments are used to interject non-code lines into code that do not show up when the code is run. In other words, if I make a comment on this page using the proper HTML tag, I can create a notation for myself (or other people viewing the source code) about the page, the code, or whatever other relevant information I deem necessary. This is super helpful when coming back to a project after a long absence or as a way of providing other people insight into your process. In HTML comments use the following tag on a single line:</p>
            <!-- See? I have left a comment here that doesn't show up on the page! -->
            <pre><code>&lt!-- Hello There! --&gt</code></pre>
            <p>Or across multiple lines:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt!--
Hello
There!
--&gt</code></pre>
            <p>Comments are covered in greater depth in the coding section (including comments for CSS and JavaScript). In general, if you see code in gray when looking at the source, it is likely a comment.</p>

        <section id="planning">
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>This section covers basic things to consider when planning your site. Depending on your idea and style of working, you may find you like much more (or less) planning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>General Concept/Idea</li>
                <li>Outline & Wireframing</li>
                <li>Visual Style</li>
                <li>Hosting and CMSs</li>
            </ul>
