        <p>
          This site comes out of my own interest in building and browsing hand
          coded websites and my teaching since the early days of the pandemic
          which has focused largely on web based projects. Rather than being a
          refined course, I see byhand.website as offering a starting point for
          artists, designers, and anyone else who is interested in building
          their own weird and wonderful corner of the internet. To that end,
          this site is written in the first person for two main reasons. First,
          I aimed to have the writing sound close to how I would explain these
          topics in conversation to make it more approachable. Approachability
          is important to me especially because much of what this site offers is
          context, and context I believe benefits from plain human language.
          Second, I don't want this site to feel like an impersonal (or
          official) resource without personality or fallibility, I do not
          consider myself an authority on the subject but instead a fellow
          learner trying to offer context and guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also comes out of a recent uptick in being asked for
          coding help from current and former students, friends, and colleagues,
          many of whom report finding large comprehensive computer science or
          business oriented resources intimidating. So, whether it's a portfolio
          page, a net art project, or anything else you can think of, I hope
          that byhand.website can be a friendly and more human guide that helps
          you find joy and excitement in hand coding websites.
